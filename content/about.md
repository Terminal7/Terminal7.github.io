## Authorial details

This site is created by Thomas Gordon, a kiwi studying computer engineering at Brown University. He previously worked part-time at Brown's [Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu/) as a Software Sustainability Intern, helping to make CCV's computing cluster more cost-effective and climate efficient. 

In his spare time, he [creates puzzlehunts](../puzzles/), [writes fiction](../fiction/), and explores the history of Rhode Island.

## Technical details

This site is run using the static site generator <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, with individual pages written using Markdown, and deployed using Netlify. I don't use a Zola theme or anything like that; any functionality on here, I have implemented myself.

This site is entirely static. That means no ads and fast load times. I plan to keep my site like this for as long as I have it up.

I also host the website for the [Bravo Puzzle Awards](https://bravopuzzleawards.com/), which uses an identical tech stack.
