Here's some extra Shardhunt content for you all.<!-- more -->

Explanation follows. If you don't care about why this exists, skip to the orange bits; those are the links to the new puzzles and essays.

### What is this?

To quote [Shardhunt's wrap-up](https://shardhunt.com/wrapup):

> We might estimate that for every puzzle released in the final hunt, approximately one more was written and cut in some stage of development.

In most cases, puzzles were cut because they were deeply flawed in some way, or weren't fit for release. Many puzzles which were cut are still usable in other puzzlehunts; potentially, in future Shardhunts (should they exist), or other hunts people may choose to work on. There were fully-working written puzzles that only a very small number of testsolvers saw, which were not published.

(Note that I don't use the word "finished". Nothing is ever finished. Only iterated upon.)

However, there are one or two puzzles of mine (or mini-puzzles in larger puzzles) which:

1) I like
2) are in a publishable state 
3) can't be used in future hunts

Since there's no point in these sitting around on my hard drive forever, I've decided to publish them. Consider this some bonus content for Shardhunt.

This "B-side" only contains puzzles or essays which are solely my work, and do not involve the work of anyone else.

### The B-side

Included: one full puzzle, some chess boards, a behind-the-scenes look at the development of Pushing the Rules, and a short commentary on some other cut content.

#### [Grapevine](grapevine)

A working puzzle that was cut from the hunt in the last few months of Shardhunt's development.

SPOILER ALERT: this puzzle has the same answer as another puzzle on Floor 3 of the Library.

You can also look at the solution [here](grapevine-sol). (The solution also discusses some aspects of Shardhunt, including the metapuzzles for Floor 3.)

#### [Through the Looking-Glass - Bonus Boards](ttlg-bonus-boards)

Some extra boards which got cut from Through the Looking-Glass for various reasons.

I've included their solution paths, along with some notes about why each of them was cut [here](ttlg-cut-reasons).

#### [The evolution of Pushing the Rules](ptr-evolution)

A behind-the-scenes look at how this puzzle evolved over time, with playable versions of past prototypes.

#### [Why did so much content get cut?](why-cut)

A short discussion about some miscellaneous cut Shardhunt content, and a bonus mini-essay discussing my own personal ethos on cutting content in general.
