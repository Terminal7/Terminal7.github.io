When I was testing Pushing the Rules during the final Shardhunt full-testsolve, I had a discussion with several testsolvers. One of them (I forget exactly who) found an alternate solution, which was both highly convoluted and quite impressive. I, of course, quickly made it impossible, but I then promised that I would release a version of the puzzle where that impressive alternate solution was the required one.

I have since forgotten exactly what that solution was. But this discussion set me on the path to write this little essay. There's been much ink spilled on how to write books; game development, certainly; movies, perhaps even more, given their glamour and glitz. I am not aware of any sort of account of someone talking, step by step, through how they chose to design a puzzle, and how it came together in the edit. Author's notes sometimes elucidate some of this, but they tend to be brief, more focused on interesting tangents than the Process.

It's also hard to provide general, sweeping advice for writing puzzles. The only way to write a good puzzle is to write many, many bad ones first. Even then, it's not a certain thing. And every person's creative process is different; the way I write puzzles will most likely be different from yours.

But I thought, at least, that this might be an interesting peek behind the curtain. How did I write Pushing the Rules? This is how.

> 'So what do you do then?' 

> 'I work on Doctor Who. [...] I'm a writer.'

> 'Oh, right, nice.'

> Pause, and then, every time, here it comes...

> 'So where d'you get your ideas from?'

> At that point, I normally say that I buy them from The Ideas Shop in Abergavenny. But in fairness, it's a good question. With no good answer.</i>

### The grind

> *A whole year of that. A year of the handle being right but the balance being wrong, of the balance being right, but the cutting edge too dull, of the cutting edge sharpened, but that threw the balance off again, of the balance returning, but now the point was fat, of the point regaining sharpness, only now the whole blade was too short and it all had to go, all had to be thrown out, all had to be done again. Again. Again.*

### The dream

> *In the eyes of those who anxiously seek perfection, a work is never truly completed — a word that for them has no sense — but abandoned; and this abandonment, of the book to the fire or to the public, whether due to weariness or to a need to deliver it for publication, is a sort of accident, comparable to the letting-go of an idea that has become so tiring or annoying that one has lost all interest in it.*
