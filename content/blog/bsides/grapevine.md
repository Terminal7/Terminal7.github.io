It’s time for the local Harvest Ball, and that means it’s time for everyone in town to mingle and chat! And, of course, to gossip…

Interestingly enough, all thirteen people in this town like to gossip in a deterministic fashion. When they learn a secret, they will follow their own rules about who they will tell and when. These rules always remain the same, although they may behave differently depending on who told them the secret. This means that if you tell one person a secret, the same people will learn the secret in the same order every time.

Each hour, a person who knows a secret but has not started telling anyone can decide to start telling people. (With one exception, people will always start telling others the hour after they learn a secret; aka as soon as possible.) They will tell one other person that secret (with another exception), and will continue telling a different person each hour until they decide to stop and tell no-one. The most times a gossiper will tell another person their secret is three; even if they may want to keep going. Once that person has ‘stopped’, they will not start telling anyone that secret ever again, even if they are told the secret again (since they already know it!) Similarly, if someone is told a secret when they are halfway through their gossiping behavior, they will simply continue with their current behavior.

You have worked out several “archetypes” of gossiping behavior that the people attending the Harvest Ball fall into:
- Announcer
- Friend-Circle Daisy Chainer
- Good Friend (there are three of these!)
- Librarian
- Loyal to the Family
- Personal Informer
- Reverse Librarian
- Tells Your Friends
- The ACE
- Three-Hour Delayed Reaction
- Tight-Lipped

You also know a few other things:
- People do not care about who knows a secret and will happily tell a secret to others who already know it if their behavior normally requires it.
- If a person wants to tell a certain group of people and has no other ordering, they will tell them in alphabetical order.
- When sorting everyone’s names alphabetically, people sort by their full names concatenated into a single string (so W. Hopkins Adams would be considered as WHOPKINSADAMS).
- If, according to their own rules, someone would need to tell themselves a secret, they will simply skip over themselves and tell the next person they would otherwise.
- People’s names don’t give you any clues or help for this puzzle; they’re just names.

The following thirteen people are attending the party:
1) **Ambrose Bierce**<br>
Friends: Dorothy Parker, Gertrude Stein
2) **Chris Lastname**<br>
Friends: Edgar Allen Toe, Westley Gibson
3) **Dorothy Parker**<br>
Friends: Ambrose Bierce, Virginia Woolf<br>
Family: Whitney Parker, Winston Parker
4) **Edgar Allen Toe**<br>
Friends: Chris Lastname, Whitney Parker
5) **Eleanor Holmes**<br>
Friends: W. Hopkins Adams, Winston Parker
6) **Gail Ann Dorsey**<br>
Friends: Westley Gibson, W. Hopkins Adams
7) **Gertrude Stein**<br>
Friends: Ambrose Bierce, Whitney Parker
8) **Richard Curtis**<br>
Friends: Virginia Woolf, Winston Parker
9) **Virginia Woolf**<br>
Friends: Dorothy Parker, Richard Curtis
10) **Westley Gibson**<br>

Friends: Edgar Allen Toe, Gertrude Stein
12) **W. Hopkins Adams**<br>

13) **Winston Parker**<br>

Knowing all of this, you decide to tell one attendee a secret and pay attention to who learns the secret and when. However, you can only note down when people learn a secret for the first time; you won’t know if people are told the secret again by others.
