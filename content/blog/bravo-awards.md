I am pleased to report that the voting for nominations in this year's Bravo Awards begins now.

The Bravo Awards are a celebration of the hunts, puzzles, and people from the community in 2023. If you would like to submit some nominations, you can do so here: https://forms.gle/q3MZg7SGu2q3HU9q9

The voting round closes December 31, 2023 11:59 PM Eastern Time. If you know that you won't be able to submit a nomination by that time, but still want to, then you can email us at bravopuzzleawards@gmail.com.

There will be another voting round to select category winners, and a final livestream presentation some time before Mystery Hunt. I probably won't blog about the finalist vote, but I will about the livestream.
